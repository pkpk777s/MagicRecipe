## Magical Recipe Book



This is a **recipe manager application** which allows users collect and view recipe alphabetically.  

The application is designed for _people who love food and cooking_ and want to collect the recipes in the computer.  

As a developer and a person who *love cooking*.  

A digital recipe book is really easy to find and use.  

And using paperless book is totally environmental friendly and saving space.

I am really excited that I can design and implement my own recipe manager application to help me cook.

Phase 4: Task 3 {
    The layout can be better. The interface can be better looking. 
    The efficiency of the app could be better by reducing loops and using efficient list or set.
    Could using multi thread to run the App.
    Instead of pop up input, using another method without pop up.
